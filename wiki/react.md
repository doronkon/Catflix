## Creating an Account  

First, let's create a new user:  

![*Create User* - Sign-up page](./images/1.png)  

Here, you can enter your details. A profile picture is optional‚Äîif you don‚Äôt upload one, the system will automatically generate one for you.  

After filling out your details, your form should look like this:

## Exploring the Home Page  

Welcome to Catflix! üéâ  

This is the home page, where you‚Äôll see:

## Admin Privileges  

By default, new users do not have admin rights. To gain admin privileges, you‚Äôll need to:  
- Use `cURL` commands.  
- Modify your user data in MongoDB by adding an `admin` field and setting it to `true`.  

Once you have admin permissions, you'll unlock the admin panel:

## Managing Categories  

### Creating a Category  
As an admin, you can create new categories. Choose a name and decide if it should be promoted.

Since we created a **promoted** category, it now appears on the home screen:
