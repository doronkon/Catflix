## Granting Admin Privileges  

By default, new users do not have admin rights. To grant admin access, follow these steps:  

### **MongoDB Method**  
1. Open **MongoDB**.  
2. Locate the newly created user.  
3. Add a **boolean field** named `"admin"` and set it to `true`.  

Your user should now look like this:  

![*Admin-mongo* - User with admin privileges in MongoDB](./images/53.png)  

That's it! üéâ You now have admin access.
